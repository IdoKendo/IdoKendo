- 👋 Hi, I’m @IdoKendo nice to meet you!
- 👀 I am a software developer with a lot of passion to processes, code quality, immaculate pipelines and infrastructures.
- 🐍 My expertise is in Python, which I have been involved with, in one way or another, since around 2010.
- 🏎️ On my day job I currently write a lot of Go, mostly for cloud-native, and Kubernetes-related projects.  
- 🦀 I’m a Rust enthusaist, I am quite fond of it, and have even used it in production for a bit.
- 📜 I use Neovim, by the way.
- ❄️ I use Nix for reproducible development environments and on my home lab. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects, either Python, Go or Rust, that I can contribute in.
- 🐘 I’m on Fosstodon https://fosstodon.org/@IdoKendo
