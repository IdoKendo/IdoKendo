- 👋 Hi, I’m @IdoKendo nice to meet you!
- 👀 I am a software developer with a lot of passion to processes, code quality, immaculate pipelines and infrastructures.
- 🐍 My main stack is Python, which I have been involved with, in one way or another, since around 2010.
- ⚙️ I’m a Rust afficianado, and although I'ver only used it in a non-professional capacity, I am quite fond of it, and like using it on any new personal project I tackle.
- 📜 I use Neovim, by the way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects, either Python or Rust, that I can contribute in.
- 🐘 I’m on Fosstodon https://fosstodon.org/@IdoKendo
